# Windows Server

What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesnâ€™t know much about computers?

A server is a specialized computer designed to provide services or resources to other computers on a network. Unlike regular computers, servers are optimized for specific tasks, have more powerful hardware, run specialized operating systems, and serve multiple users or devices simultaneously.

How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?

Windows Server typically receives updates through services like Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) or Windows Update for Business (WUfB), allowing system administrators to have more control over the update process. In contrast, Windows Home/Pro versions receive updates through Windows Update, with users having some control over installation timing.

Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro? 

es, Windows Server generally has higher hardware requirements, including more powerful processors, more RAM, larger and faster storage, advanced networking capabilities, and features for reliability and redundancy, compared to Windows Home or Pro. This is because servers are designed to handle more demanding workloads and serve multiple users simultaneously.
