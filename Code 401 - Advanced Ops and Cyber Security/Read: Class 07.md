# Protecting Data at Rest with Device Encryption

From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.

Data at rest: Emails on a Server
Data in transit: Sending an Email

Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.

 For confidentiality, encryption transforms sensitive data into unreadable formats, accessible only to authorized individuals with decryption keys. To maintain data integrity, encryption mechanisms often include ways to detect unauthorized alterations to data. Although encryption does not directly ensure availability, it supports secure protocols that protect against disruptions, helping ensure data remains accessible as needed. Thus, encryption is a fundamental security measure in both data transmission and storage contexts.
