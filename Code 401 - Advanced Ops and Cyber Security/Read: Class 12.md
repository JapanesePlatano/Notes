What are three tasks which SOCs often perform?

Security Monitoring
Incident Response
Threat Intelligence

Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms.

 it gathers and analyzes information from different sources within an organizationâ€™s network to detect and respond to  security threats. SOCs use SIEM to gain real-time visibility into their security environment, enabling them to identify and act on suspicious activities promptly.

How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk

Both SOC and IT Help Desk teams use a tiered structure. In a SOC, Level 1 analysts handle initial threat detection and escalate issues as needed, similar to how IT Help Desk Tier 1 staff handle basic issues before escalating complex problems to higher tiers. Higher levels in both structures deal with more advanced and specialized tasks, ensuring efficient problem resolution and proactive management.
