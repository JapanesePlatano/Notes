It protects individuals, organizations, and societies from cyber threats, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, systems, and services in an increasingly interconnected and digital world
How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
sophisticated attacks often involve a combination of both hardware and software techniques to achieve a specific goal. Hardware attacks might be used to gain initial access, and then software attacks could be employed to maintain persistence or manipulate the system further. Both types of hacks pose significant security challenges, and comprehensive security measures should address vulnerabilities at both the hardware and software levels.

What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?
Interdiction
seeding changes from the very beginning.

Explain how the hack worked.
the chips allowed the attackers to create a stealth doorway into any network that included the altered machines.

"Investigators found: The chips had been inserted during the manufacturing process, two officials say, by operatives from a unit of the People’s Liberation Army. In Supermicro, China’s spies appear to have found a perfect conduit for what U.S."1
