# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

1.	What does “OSI” stand for?

Open Systems Interconnection

2.	List the 7 layers of the OSI model and what each one is responsible for.

•	Physical Layer
•	Data Link Layer
•	Network Layer
•	Transport Layer
•	Session Layer
•	Presentation Layer
•	Application Layer

3.	Distinguish which layers are the “hardware layers”, and which layers are the “software layers”. 

The Physical and Data Link Layers are considered hardware layers as they deal directly with the physical transmission of data, while the Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application Layers are considered software layers.

4.	What does that even mean?

The OSI model provides a structured approach to understanding how different layers of communication systems work together to enable communication between devices and applications over networks. Each layer has specific functions and responsibilities, contributing to the overall process of data transmission and exchange.

5.	How can the OSI model be used in troubleshooting?

It helps identify where problems occur, isolate their causes, and use layer-specific tools for diagnosis. By following a structured approach based on the OSI model, network technicians can efficiently resolve issues, minimize downtime, and ensure smooth network operation.

1.	What is Wireshark?

Is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to your home office or the internet. Packet is the name given to a discrete unit of data in a typical Ethernet network.

2.	What is a packet?

A packet refers to a unit of data that is transmitted over a network.

3.	What 3 high-level things does Wireshark accomplish? How could these be used for nefarious purposes? For benevolent purposes?

•	Packet Capture: Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic – quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a time.
•	Filtering: Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain just the information you need to see.
•	Visualization: Wireshark, like any good packet sniffer, allows you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also allows you to visualize entire conversations and network streams.

Eavesdropping on sensitive communications, stealing data, or launching attacks by analyzing network traffic patterns. However, they can also be used for benevolent purposes, such as network troubleshooting, monitoring network performance, detecting security threats, and ensuring compliance with network policies.
