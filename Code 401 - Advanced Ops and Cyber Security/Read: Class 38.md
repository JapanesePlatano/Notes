# Attacking Juice Shop with Burp Suite

Explain how Burp Suite allows us to analyze web application traffic.

Burp Suite enables the analysis of web application traffic by intercepting and inspecting the requests and responses between a browser and a web server. This allows users to see the data being sent and received, modify requests, and analyze the application's behavior and security vulnerabilities.

What does the Repeater tool allow us to do with requests?

The Repeater tool in Burp Suite allows users to manually modify and resend individual HTTP requests. This enables testing and experimenting with different inputs to observe how the web application responds, which helps in identifying vulnerabilities and understanding application logic.

Why might this be a useful tool for an attacker?

This tool is useful for an attacker because it allows them to craft specific HTTP requests to exploit vulnerabilities, test payloads, and understand how the application processes inputs. This can help in finding and exploiting weaknesses such as injection flaws, authentication bypasses, and other security issues.
