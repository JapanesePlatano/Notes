# Readings: Installing Ubuntu Linux
•	What is Ubuntu?

Ubuntu is a popular open-source Linux distribution that is based on Debian. It is known for its user-friendly interface and widespread community support. Ubuntu is designed to be easy to use and includes a variety of pre-installed software for common tasks. It's widely used for both desktop and server environments.

•	Why would you choose to install the LTS version over regular Ubuntu releases?

Ubuntu releases two types of versions - LTS (Long Term Support) and regular releases. LTS versions are supported for five years, providing stability and security updates over an extended period. Regular releases have a shorter support cycle (usually nine months) and include the latest software versions and features. Choosing LTS is recommended for users who prioritize stability and don't need the latest features immediately. Regular releases are more suitable for users who want the latest software updates and features at the expense of a shorter support period.

•	What is the Ubuntu GNOME Shell?

GNOME Shell is the default desktop environment for Ubuntu. It provides a modern, user-friendly interface with features like a top bar, application launcher, and activities overview. Ubuntu's GNOME Shell is a customized version tailored to the Ubuntu experience. It includes specific themes, icons, and pre-installed applications that align with Ubuntu's design philosophy.

## Things I want to know more about

Linux command lines are not my forte. I would like to be more proficient with general command lines.
