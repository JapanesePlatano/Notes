# Reconstructing a Cloud Attack with Splunk

What are the benefits of a forward proxy?

A forward proxy hides the user's IP address by substituting it with its own, ensuring privacy and protecting against tracking and surveillance. Organizations can use forward proxies to restrict or allow access to specific websites or content, enforcing browsing policies. By caching frequently accessed web content, forward proxies can reduce bandwidth usage and improve load times. They can also block access to malicious or inappropriate websites, providing an additional layer of security. Additionally, forward proxies offer a centralized point to log and monitor internet usage, which is useful for compliance and security purposes.

Explain the differences between a forward and a reverse proxy?

A forward proxy sits between the user and the internet, handling outbound traffic and providing anonymity, access control, and content filtering. In contrast, a reverse proxy sits between the internet and the web server, handling inbound traffic to enhance security, load balancing, and performance for web servers by managing incoming requests.

Explain to your manager why your organization might benefit from implementing a reverse proxy?

A reverse proxy will enhance our security by hiding server IPs and blocking malicious traffic. It will improve load balancing and ensure high availability by distributing traffic across multiple servers. It simplifies SSL management and reduces server load by handling encryption. Caching and compressing content will speed up response times and save bandwidth. Additionally, it optimizes web traffic and acts as a firewall, protecting against common web exploits.
