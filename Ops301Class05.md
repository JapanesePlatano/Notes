What is a site-to-site VPN?

A site-to-sitevirtual private network (VPN) refers to a configured connection between multiple networks. This can be a corporate network where multiple offices work together or a branch network with a central office and multiple branches.

What is TCP/IP and what is it used for?

TCP/IP describes how data is organized based on packets, addresses given, transmitted, and received on different computers on the Internet. Before the launch of the Internet as we know it today, computers were connected between sites via a private network and TCP/IP. In this way, site-to-site networks predated the Internet, forming the basis of what we have today.

What are some popular reasons for using a VPN?

The modern iteration of a VPN has grown in popularity because people want to hide their IP addresses and browse the internet more securely. A hidden IP address gives you the freedom to download torrents without revealing who you are. You can also access geo-blocked content regardless of your location. Also, on a public network, you have to deal with a constant barrage of cyberattacks, but with a VPN, you can enjoy a more secure and encrypted connection. These attributes have made private VPNs a top choice among individual users.

Explain the difference between the three types of VPNs.

A remote access VPN refers to a temporary connection configured between two or more users and a central location. In most cases, a remote access VPN is used to give each location access to a data center. In some situations, a connection that uses Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is sufficient. 

An intranet-based site-to-site VPN connects more than one local area network (LAN) to form a wide area network (WAN).

Extranet VPNs are often used by two or more different companies that want to share some resources, but keep others private. With an extranet site-to-site VPN, each entity connects to the VPN and chooses what they want to make available to other businesses.
