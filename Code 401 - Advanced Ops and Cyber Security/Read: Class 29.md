# Modeling a Web Application

Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.

Threat modeling is like making your home safe. You think about what bad things might happen, like someone breaking in or a fire. Then, you decide what important things you want to protect, like your toys or special books. You look for ways someone could get in or how a fire could start, like open windows or things that can catch fire easily. Finally, you put in place things to keep you safe, like locks on the doors and smoke detectors.

What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?

What are we building?

What can go wrong?

What are we going to do about it?

Did we do a good job?

You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?

Threat modeling helps identify potential security issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities. It ensures that we build a secure application by anticipating and mitigating threats, saving time and resources in the long run, and protecting our users and data from potential attacks.
