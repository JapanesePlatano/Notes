# Cloud Security Principles and Frameworks

Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background.

AWS, like a multi-story building, offers various levels of abstraction. At the foundation, there's the physical infrastructure managed by AWS, housing hardware like servers and networking equipment. Above that, virtual servers provide customizable computing power. Managed services handle maintenance tasks for databases, storage, and more, while platform services offer tools and frameworks for application development without managing underlying infrastructure. At the highest level, serverless computing allows users to upload code and let AWS handle execution without the need to manage servers directly. Each level caters to different needs and levels of control over the technology stack.

What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?

The control plane manages and orchestrates containers at a higher level, while the data plane handles the actual processing of data within the containers themselves.

Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by AWS, offering a high level of abstraction where users upload code without managing servers. It falls under the category of managed services, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code to respond to events. Lambda automatically handles server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance, making it highly scalable and cost-effective, as users only pay for the compute time consumed by their functions.
