# Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS?

Functionality: Firewalls block malicious traffic, acting as a barrier, while IDS detects and alerts on suspicious activity without blocking it.
Placement and Operation: Firewalls are placed at network boundaries to control incoming and outgoing traffic, whereas IDS monitors network traffic for signs of breaches within the network.

Under what circumstances would you choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS?

A network-based IDS is preferred when you need to monitor and protect a large number of devices and systems across the network, providing comprehensive visibility into all network traffic without installing software on individual hosts.

Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS?

High False Positive Rate
Lack of Encrypted Traffic Analysis
Susceptibility to Protocol-Based Attacks
