2. Add diced carrots and celery to the pan. Cook for another 5 minutes until vegetables are tender.

3. Add ground meat to the pan, breaking it apart with a spoon. Cook until browned.

Now, let's move on to a new guitar scale. How about the Dorian mode?

**Dorian Mode on Guitar:**

Let's take the D Dorian mode as an example. The Dorian mode is a minor scale with a unique character. Here's how you can play it starting on the 5th fret of the guitar (D position):

```
e|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
B|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
G|-----------------|-----------------|-------------4-5-|-5-4-------------|
D|-----------------|-5-7-5-----------|---5-7-5-------5-----7-5---------|
A|-------------5-7-|-------7-5-------|---------7-5---------------7-5-|
E|-5-7-5-7-8-------|-----------8-7-5-|-------------------------------|
```

This is just one position; feel free to explore the Dorian mode in different positions on the fretboard to enrich your understanding.
