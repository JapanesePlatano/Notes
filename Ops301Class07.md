# Readings: Web Server Deployment

What are some common use cases for NGINX?

Web Serving: NGINX can serve static content like HTML, CSS, and images quickly and efficiently. It can also act as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to other servers like application servers or caching servers.

Load Balancing: NGINX can distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and reliability. This helps in handling large amounts of traffic without overloading any single server.

Reverse Proxying: NGINX can act as a reverse proxy, which means it sits in front of web servers and forwards client requests to those servers. This adds an extra layer of security and can also help with tasks like SSL termination.

Caching: NGINX can cache content, reducing the load on backend servers and speeding up delivery to clients. This is particularly useful for serving static content or for caching API responses.

Security: NGINX provides various features for enhancing security, such as limiting the number of requests a client can make, blocking malicious IP addresses, and protecting against DDoS attacks.

How does NGINX handle tasks that could slow down the web server?

By efficiently processing incoming requests and managing system resources. It's designed to be lightweight and highly scalable, so it can handle a large number of concurrent connections without slowing down

Describe, as if to a non-technical friend how to actually pronounce “NGINX”, and why an org might chooose to use it.

It is pronounced as "engine X". The reason an organization might choose to use NGINX is because it offers high performance, scalability, and flexibility, making it ideal for handling modern web applications and high-traffic websites. Additionally, NGINX is open-source and widely supported, with a large community of users and contributors, which means there's plenty of resources and expertise available for implementing and optimizing it for various use cases.
