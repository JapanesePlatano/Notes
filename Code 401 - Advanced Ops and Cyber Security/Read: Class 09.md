How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.

If you were to send a sealed letter to a friend, and you want to ensure no one else can read it or pretend to be your friend to send fake replies. PKI acts like a set of special tools for the digital world. It uses a digital "seal" (encryption) to ensure that messages you send over the internet can only be read by the intended website, like your bank or social media. It also checks that the website you're communicating with is really who they claim to be, preventing you from sending your information to an imposter. This system keeps your online activities, like shopping or banking, private and secure, ensuring they're only shared between you and the legitimate website.

What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?

It's reliance on Certificate Authorities
