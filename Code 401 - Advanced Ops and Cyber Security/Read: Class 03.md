# Cyber Risk Analysis

Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?

To ensure a bank ATM adheres to the principles of the CIA triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—several security measures are necessary. Confidentiality can be maintained through encryption, robust authentication mechanisms like PINs or biometrics, and privacy screens. Integrity is safeguarded by implementing data validation, maintaining transaction logs, using hardware security modules for cryptographic tasks, and employing checksums and hashing to ensure data consistency. Availability is ensured by equipping ATMs with redundant components, conducting regular maintenance, having a disaster recovery plan in place, and protecting against network disruptions like DoS attacks. These combined measures help create a secure, reliable, and trustworthy banking experience for users.

Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.

Regular patch management and software updates to mitigate vulnerabilities.

Data backup and recovery plans to ensure data integrity and availability in case of disruptions.

The use of robust security protocols and tools like firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems. 

What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stage’s main goal or objective?

Risk Assessment: Identifies, analyzes, and prioritizes risks based on their potential impact and likelihood.  

Risk Mitigation: Aims to develop and implement strategies to reduce identified risks to acceptable levels, choosing appropriate actions such as avoiding, transferring, or directly mitigating the risks. Finally, 

Risk Monitoring and Review: Focuses on continuously monitoring the risk environment and the effectiveness of implemented controls, ensuring that the risk management strategies remain effective and adapt to new threats and organizational changes.
