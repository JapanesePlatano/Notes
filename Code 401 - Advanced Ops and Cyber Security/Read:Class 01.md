# Strategic Policy Development

How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?

By talking about the benefits it brings to the company such as;

Client Trust: SOC2 demonstrates commitment to safeguarding client data, enhancing reputation and trust.

Competitive Advantage: Compliance sets you apart from competitors, opening new business opportunities.

Risk Mitigation: Proactively addressing security risks minimizes data breaches, saving time and resources.

What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?

Privacy
Security
Availability
Processing Intengrity
Confidentiality

How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?

Level 1 - Security: Like a strong foundation for a house, it establishes fundamental security measures.

Level 2 - Availability: Ensures systems are reliable and accessible, akin to a house being resistant to external factors.

Level 3 - Confidentiality: Focuses on safeguarding sensitive data, similar to securing valuables within a home.
