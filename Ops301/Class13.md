# Active Directory

What exactly is “Active Directory” and what are the key services it provides?

Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft directory service providing centralized management for network objects like users and devices. It offers authentication, authorization, directory services, policy enforcement, and single sign-on.

What are the differences between a domain, forest, and tree in Active Directory?

In AD, a domain is a group of network objects, a tree is a hierarchy of domains with a common namespace, and a forest is a collection of trees sharing a schema and configuration.

How can objects (e.g. users, devices) within a domain be grouped?

Objects in a domain can be grouped using organizational units (OUs), security groups, and distribution groups.

Explain the benefits of Active Directory, as you would to a family member.

Active Directory benefits include simplified network management, centralized authentication, consistent policy enforcement, streamlined administration, and enhanced productivity for users.
