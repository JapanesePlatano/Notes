# Malware Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.

As a Malware Analyst, my job is like being a detective for computers. Imagine if bad guys tried to sneak into our house with tricks. I figure out how they do it, what they want, and how to stop them. I look at the bad guys' tools very carefully to understand how they work and make plans to keep our house safe. I work with a team to make sure we stay protected from any sneaky attacks.

What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? Whatâ€™s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?

Collection: Gather malware samples.

Isolation: Sandbox the samples.

Static Analysis: Analyze without execution.

Dynamic Analysis: Observe behavior during execution.

Documentation: Record findings.

Remediation: Develop countermeasures.

You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?

Static Analysis would be conducted first. This method involves examining the malware without executing it, which is safer and provides initial insights into the file structure, strings, and metadata. It helps to understand the potential threat without risking infection or further spread.
