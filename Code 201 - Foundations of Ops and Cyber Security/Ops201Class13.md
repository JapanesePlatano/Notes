# Cloud Virtualization with AWS

1.	How has virtualization evolved beyond desktops and servers?

Virtualization has evolved beyond its initial applications in desktops and servers, extending into diverse domains such as network and storage virtualization, application virtualization, desktop virtualization (VDI), serverless computing, containerization, edge virtualization, 5G Network Function Virtualization (NFV), desktop application streaming, AI and GPU virtualization, and IoT virtualization. These advancements offer flexibility, efficiency, and scalability across various IT environments, promoting streamlined resource management, centralized control, improved security, and consistent application deployment.
2.	In the context of the Amazon IaaS Cloud Service Model, what does EC2 stand for?
