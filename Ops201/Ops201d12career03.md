# Talk to Your Network

Read this article on “How many jobs are found through networking, really?”.

Assignment

Arrange a 1:1 informational meeting with someone already in your network. Keep it casual and professional. This is perfect time to learn more about what impact the person is making professionally, practice your pitch, and learn how you might be able to help that person.
Submit a discussion with a short summary of:

•	who you met with? 

My Partner.

•	how you are connected to them?

We work for the Naval Shipyard in Bremerton. 

•	what you learned about that person and their work?

She is a Nuclear Engineer and now works for the team that designs the training for the naval personnel inside the reactors of carriers.

•	and how you can help them.

My goal after graduating from Codefellows is to land a job at Code 109 in the Shipyard. This is the equivalent of an IT department for the DOD. In there, my starting position is would be as a help desk technician.
