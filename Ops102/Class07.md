# Readings: Network Connectivity

1.	What is the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol?
   
is a cryptographic network protocol designed to secure remote access and administration of servers over unsecured networks. It employs encryption to safeguard communication between the client and the server, preventing unauthorized access.

3.	What are the typical uses of the SSH protocol?

secure remote administration, encrypted file transfers, and the establishment of secure tunnels for various protocols, ensuring the confidentiality of transmitted data.

4.	How does the SSH protocol work?

SSH relies on public-key cryptography for authentication, allowing the remote computer to authenticate the user. It establishes a secure, encrypted connection with support for various authentication methods.

5.	How is the data kept safe when transmitted between the SSH client and server?

During transmission, data is encrypted using cryptographic algorithms like AES, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity in the communication between the SSH client and server.

6.	What is SFTP?

SFTP, or Secure File Transfer Protocol, is a component of SSH that provides a secure means of transferring files between the client and server, offering encryption similar to FTP.

What is RDP? And how to use it
