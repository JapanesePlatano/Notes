# Readings: Startup Sequences and BIOS

•	What is the BIOS?

The BIOS is a firmware embedded on the motherboard of a computer. It initializes and manages the hardware components during the booting process. It acts as a bridge between the operating system and the computer's hardware.

•	Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?

I was a work center supervisor in the navy. My job consisted of coordinating the maintenance that needed to be done for the work center throughout the week, as well as assigning such maintenance to specific people with the credentials required to perform the maintenance on their respective system. The bios works in a similar way, it sets the tempo, ensures everyone is in tune, and provides the initial instructions for the performance.

•	What is the “Power On Self Test”?

POST is a diagnostic process performed by the BIOS during boot-up. It checks if essential hardware components are functioning correctly. If any issues are detected, the BIOS may halt the boot process and provide error messages to alert the user.

•	What is the CMOS?

CMOS is a small amount of volatile memory on the motherboard that stores BIOS settings, date, and time. It retains this information even when the computer is powered off. The settings stored in CMOS are crucial for the proper functioning of the system.

•	What is the CMOS battery?

The CMOS battery provides a small, constant power supply to the CMOS memory. It ensures that important settings and system information are retained even when the computer is turned off. If the CMOS battery fails, the stored information may be lost, and the computer might encounter issues like incorrect date and time settings.
