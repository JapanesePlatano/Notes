# Understanding how to build a computer is pertinent to cybersecurity for various reasons. It allows for assessing and mitigating hardware vulnerabilities, ensuring secure configurations, and evaluating the security features of components for risk management. Knowledge in technologies like Secure Boot and Trusted Platform Module contributes to system integrity. The ability to customize security features, coupled with awareness of system architecture, aids in digital forensics, incident response, and ethical hacking. Overall, building a computer fosters a security-minded approach, making it an essential skill for cybersecurity professionals.

1.	Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
   
•	The choice between more cores and higher clock speed depends on your common tasks.

•	More Cores: Valuable for multitasking, content creation, and parallel processing like video editing or rendering.

•	Higher Speed (Clock Frequency): Beneficial for tasks relying on single-threaded performance, such as gaming or specific professional applications.

•	The optimal number of CPU cores varies; for general use, a quad-core processor is usually sufficient, while content creators might prefer six or eight cores.

2.	What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
   
•	Ensure compatibility with the CPU socket.

•	Check for the required RAM slots and supported RAM speeds.

•	Consider the expansion slots for graphics cards, NVMe drives, and peripherals.

•	Examine the number and types of USB ports, audio ports, and networking options.

•	Choose a form factor (ATX, microATX, mini-ITX) based on your case size and available space.

3.	What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
   
•	HDD vs. SSD: HDDs provide more storage at a lower cost per GB but are slower. SSDs are faster, more durable, and energy-efficient but are generally more expensive.

•	SATA vs. NVMe: SATA SSDs are budget-friendly but have lower data transfer rates. NVMe SSDs offer faster data access but come at a higher cost.

•	Capacity vs. Speed: Higher-capacity drives are cost-effective for storage, but speed may be sacrificed. Smaller-capacity SSDs might be faster but at a higher cost per GB.

4.	Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
   
•	Processor (CPU): Think of it as the brain, responsible for all calculations and tasks.

•	Memory (RAM): Functions like short-term memory, used for active tasks and applications.

•	Storage (HDD/SSD): Acts as long-term memory for storing files, programs, and the operating system.

•	Motherboard: Functions as the main circuit board, connecting all components like the nervous system.

•	Graphics Card (GPU): Manages visuals, crucial for gaming and graphic-intensive tasks.

•	Power Supply (PSU): Supplies power to all components, resembling the heart of the computer.

•	Cooling System: Prevents components from overheating, serving as the computer's cooling system.
