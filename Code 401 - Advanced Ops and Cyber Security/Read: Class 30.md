# Malware Detection with YARA Rules

What is the main goal of Threat Hunting and how is it different from traditional threat monitoring?

The main goal of threat hunting is to search for cyber threats that are lurking unnoticed in a network, system, or environment. It differs from threat monitoring, which relies on automated tools and alerts to identify known threats. Threat hunting relies on using human intuition and expertise to uncover advanced threats and anomalies that automated systems may miss.

What are the four types of YARA rules and what does each one of them use to identify and classify malicious software?

Basic Rules: Use string matching to identify specific patterns within files.

Combination Rules: Combine multiple string matches with logical operators to refine detection.

Metadata Rules: Include descriptive information about the rule, such as author, date, and description.

Modules Rules: Utilize external modules to incorporate complex logic and additional features for advanced detection capabilities.

How are YARA rules similar to how Anti-Virus programs detect malicious software?

YARA rules and anti-virus programs both detect malicious software by searching for specific patterns or signatures within files. YARA rules allow for flexible and customizable pattern matching, similar to how anti-virus programs use predefined signatures to identify threats. Both methods recognize and classify malware based on characteristic code fragments and behaviors.
