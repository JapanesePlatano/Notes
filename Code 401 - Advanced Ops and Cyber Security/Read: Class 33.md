# Threat Hunting with Security Onion

How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?

Threat Hunting: Proactive search for indicators of compromise within a network to detect threats before they cause harm.

Pentesting: Simulated attacks on a system to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?

The primary objective of Threat Hunting is to identify and mitigate threats within a network before they cause damage, improving overall security posture.

Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but not active Threat Hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?

I would  emphasize that Threat Hunting complements SOC activities by  identifying threats that traditional monitoring may miss, thus making security better and reducing potential damage from undetected threats.
