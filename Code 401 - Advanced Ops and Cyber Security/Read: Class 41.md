### How are the stages of a pen test similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain?

Both the stages of a pen test and the Cyber Kill Chain involve steps to find and exploit weaknesses. The pen test stages (planning, scanning, accessing, maintaining access, and reporting) are like the Cyber Kill Chain steps (reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions). Both methods focus on understanding the target, exploiting vulnerabilities, keeping access, and analyzing results.

### Explaining the Benefits of a Pen Test to Leadership

Pen testing offers several key benefits:

1. **Finds Weak Spots**: Identifies vulnerabilities before attackers do, allowing for fixes.
2. **Improves Security**: Enhances overall security by addressing discovered issues.
3. **Meets Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements and manage risks.
4. **Saves Money**: Prevents costly breaches and damage control.
5. **Simulates Real Attacks**: Provides a realistic test of defenses.
