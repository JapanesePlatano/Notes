Troubleshooting Techniques

What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?

Identify the issues, come up with solutions and test solution. In the case of multiple issues, start with the one that is the most serious first.

What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?

If a solution has been found, go ahead and make the changes, verify it works and if it does, write it down for future reference.

What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?

Future reference, If the same issue happens again, you can go back to your notes, fix the issue again or if the issue is not fixed, revise them and come up with new solutions to fix the issue

Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?

Almost everyone has a smartphone nowadays, but a lot of people don't know how to utilize them to their full extent, there could be generational barriers that impede people older than me from fully understanding what the device is capable of doing like connecting a set of Bluetooth headphones to their device and struggling to do so. It is important to know your audience and how to deal with them. If I am to help an old person perform such task I would gather information on what they are trying to accomplish, Identify the issue, come up with a plan and execute a solution i.e. something like this: old person cannot use their Bluetooth headphones>Maybe they do not know how to connect their headphones to their smartphone>teach them how to connect their Bluetooth headphones to their smartphone>Show them step by step on how to do so.
