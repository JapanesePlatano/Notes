# Malware Remediation Tools and Techniques

1.	What are the main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software? 

Antivirus software traditionally targeted viruses, relying on signature-based detection, while anti-malware encompasses a broader range of threats, including viruses, Trojans, worms, and more.

2.	What are some signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infection on your PC? 

sluggish performance, unusual system behavior, increased pop-ups, altered browser settings, unexpected data usage, disabled security software, abnormal network activity, missing or modified files, high CPU usage, and unauthorized email or message activity.

3.	Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using antimalware software.

Full system scans provide a comprehensive examination of the entire system, offering a higher likelihood of detecting deeply embedded or less common malware but taking more time. On the other hand, quick scans are faster and focus on high-risk areas, making them suitable for regular checks but potentially missing certain types of threats.

4.	What should you do if your computer is infected with ransomware?

Disconnect from the network. Refrain from paying the ransom, report the incident to law enforcement.

5.	Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology users?

Malware and viruses are more common on windows PCs than any other Operating System, but this does not mean that Mac OS or Linux are invulnerable to bad actors, it is a good Idea if possible, to follow the same measures that you would take with a windows PC.
