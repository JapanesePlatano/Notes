### What is SQL Injection?

SQL injection is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database, often leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.

### Example of SQL Injection

A hacker could exploit a login form by entering `admin' --` as the username and any password, causing the query to ignore the password check and granting unauthorized access as the "admin" user.

### Ways to Prevent SQL Injection Attacks

1. **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** 
2. **Stored Procedures:** 
3. **Input Validation:** 
4. **Escaping User Input:** 
5. **Least Privilege Principle:** 
6. **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** 
7. **Regular Security Audits:**
